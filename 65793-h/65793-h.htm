<p class="pcap">With your International Harvester Refrigerator
to provide you with a generous
supply of ice cubes, you will
be serving many cooling, colorful beverages
in the summer time. Here are
some suggestions for making these
mid-afternoon and evening pick-ups
especially refreshing.</p>
</div>
<h4>ICE CUBES FOR COLD DRINKS</h4>
<p>Use either crushed or whole cubes. Crushed ice cools beverages more quickly;
cubes last longer and add a pleasant tinkle.</p>
<h4>FANCY ICE CUBES</h4>
<p>Freeze curls of lemon or orange peel, maraschino cherries with stems, or sprigs
of mint, a raspberry or strawberry in ice cubes.</p>
<p>Freeze leftover fruit drinks in the ice-cube trays to serve in iced tea or other
beverages.</p>
<p>For fancy cubes, freeze the cubes slowly to prevent cloudiness and expansion.
If fruit is to be frozen in the cube, fill tray &#8531; full of liquid, partially freeze and
add fruit. Allow to freeze into position. Add water to within &frac14; inch of top of
tray and finish freezing.</p>
<p>Freeze punch in cubes or in a block&mdash;ideal for chilling the punch bowl and
cooling the beverage. Children will love these frozen cubes of sweet fruit flavor
if sticks are inserted in the mixture when nearly frozen so they will resemble
frozen suckers.</p>
<h4>TO FROST RIMS OF GLASSES</h4>
<p>Put lemon juice into a shallow dish. Sift superfine granulated or powdered sugar
onto a plate&mdash;about &frac14; inch deep. Invert each glass in the lemon juice. Lift out
of juice, place into the sugar for a minute. Lift carefully out of the sugar so as
not to jar the sugar coating which has formed on the rim. Place in the refrigerator
until &ldquo;set.&rdquo; Fill glasses with the beverage, being careful not to disturb the frost.</p>
<h4>USE OF SYRUPS</h4>
<p>Keep several kinds of syrups on hand in your refrigerator. Leftover syrup from
canned fruit makes a delicious base for chilled fruit beverages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>

<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="663" />
<p class="pcap">You can easily make delicious,
smooth-textured frozen desserts
in your International Harvester
refrigerator.  And you can add
variations of your own choice. Fruits in season add a luscious taste as do
flavors such as chocolate, coffee, maple, caramel, marshmallow or nuts.
Having a supply of ice cream variations on hand in your refrigerator will
be a convenience and will provide tempting treats for you and your family.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c9">ICE CREAM</h3>
<p>Ice cream frozen in a household refrigerator usually employs special ingredients
such as whole eggs, egg yolks, gelatin, corn syrup, flour or cornstarch, or hot
syrup poured over egg yolks or whites to counteract the formation of ice crystals.
These ingredients add body and richness and contribute to the smoothness
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
by producing finer ice crystals. They also increase the amount of air that can be
incorporated, resulting in a greater volume. Combinations that are too sweet
will not freeze firm in a refrigerator. A good proportion is 1 part sugar to 4
parts liquid.</p>
<p>To freeze ice cream, set the cold control for fast freezing (coldest position).
Pour the mixture into the tray and place it on the bottom of the freezing compartment
in contact with the refrigerated surface. Freeze until firm throughout.
Remove the frozen mixture from the tray to a chilled bowl and break up the
mixture with wooden spoon (a wooden spoon does not conduct heat from the
hand as a metal one does). Work quickly. Beat with an electric mixer or a rotary
beater until mass is free of hard lumps. Gently fold in egg whites or whipped
cream. Return the mixture at once to the tray and place it in the freezing compartment.
Moisten the bottom of tray to insure good contact and to hasten freezing.
When frozen, reset cold control at midway between normal and coldest
point to mellow ice cream until time to serve.</p>

<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">Chilled Desserts</span></h2>
<p>There are many delectable desserts made from a gelatin base. These are
usually called Whips, Snows, or Creams, according to the fruit combination,
such as Cherry Whip, Grape Snow, or Pineapple Bavarian Cream. Other desserts
which have eye and taste appeal are combinations of fruit, gelatin or
cream fillings plus cake or cookie foundation. Again, these are ideal ways to
use the last of the angel food, sponge or plain cake or extend a small amount
of a food to fit your current needs.</p>
<p>Snow puddings attain a characteristic light, airy texture through the addition
of beaten egg whites which are folded in when the gelatin mixture begins
to set. The same holds true of Bavarian creams except that whipped cream
takes the place of the egg whites.</p>
<p>To use plain gelatin as a base, soften gelatin in a small amount of cold
liquid. Stir into the hot liquid. For general use, allow 1 envelope of gelatin to
2 cups of liquid. If acid fruit juices are used, the proportion of 1 envelope of
gelatin to 1&frac34; cups liquid is more satisfactory. To hasten setting of gelatin mixtures
and to preserve the fresh fruit flavors, heat only half of the liquid to dissolve
the softened gelatin. Then add the other half cold. <i>Note</i>: Fresh pineapple
juice or pulp must be scalded before using with gelatin because of an enzyme
in fresh pineapple that keeps gelatin from jelling.</p>
<p>To remove molded gelatin desserts, dip mold into a pan of warm (not hot)
water for about 30 seconds. The water should come almost to the top of the mold.
Then dessert can be removed easily to the serving plate by inverting mold on
the plate. Turn mold over carefully and dessert will remain on plate; this action
is done in the same manner as one removes a cake from the pan.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="662" />
<p class="pcap">The secret of a successful salad is thorough chilling and crisping of all ingredients.
Salad greens should be thoroughly cleaned and dried; fruits well drained;
meat, fish and cheese cut into bite-size pieces of uniform shape. Eye-appeal is
important. Add colorful garnishes to a salad that is not naturally colorful.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Salads for the main course should contain some protein-rich foods, such as
chicken, meat, fish, or cheese, and vegetables. Marinate meat or vegetables separately
in a tart French dressing and combine just before serving. Mayonnaise
or cooked dressings give added food value and body to salads of this kind. For
meat, chicken or fish salads, allow &frac12; cup ingredients and 2 tablespoons dressing
per serving. The salad will be more attractive if the pieces are large enough
to be identified.</p>
</div>
<p><b>MIXED GREEN SALAD</b>: A green salad served before, after or with a hearty main
course should be light and tangy, the servings should be small, and the dressing
tart. Greens can include lettuce, chicory, romaine, water cress or endive. Other
raw vegetables can be added, such as tomatoes, radishes, onions, cucumbers, carrots,
beets, spinach leaves, turnips, and cauliflower or broccoli flowerettes.</p>
<p><b>SALAD TACTICS</b>: When choosing the dressing to accompany the salad, remember
a safe rule to follow is simple dressings for accompaniment salads, hearty
dressings for main-course salads and sweet dressings for dessert salads. Too much
dressing can ruin a salad. It is best to season salads lightly and provide additional
dressing on the side.</p>
<p>Dip fruits that darken in lemon juice. Pieces of fruit should be large enough
so they can be identified. Many of the smaller fruits and berries can be left whole
or halved. Allow &frac12; cup fruit per serving. Handle salad foods lightly. Do not mix
excessively, or packing and bruising may result. Keep salads in the refrigerator
until ready to serve. Long waiting in room temperature causes them to lose their
crispness. It is good practice to chill the salad plates in your refrigerator before
serving the salad. This applies especially to fruit and gelatin salads.</p>

<p class="tb"><b>MOLDED SALADS</b>: Before using the mold or molds when making gelatin salads,
rinse them in cold water. Leave excess moisture on the molds, or brush
molds lightly with salad oil. If square sided molds are used they can be lined
with strips of cellophane. If individual molds are not available, small muffin
pans will serve as a convenient substitute, or pour the mixture into an ice cube
tray with the metal grid in position. Place the tray on the food compartment
shelf until salad sets. A plain gelatin base or a flavored base may be used for
the salad. Your choice depends upon the other ingredients that make up the salad.</p>

<p class="pcap">It is a particular advantage to have refrigerated dough for fresh rolls when
entertaining or if the family is small and cannot use a full recipe at one time.
Almost any yeast roll may be refrigerated three or four days satisfactorily.
However, the recipe should contain plenty of yeast and sugar. When ready
to use, the dough can be formed into rolls of any desired shape or into coffee
cake. Refrigerating the dough at from 40&deg;F. to 50&deg;F. retards yeast activity.
The surface of the dough must be greased and covered tightly to prevent drying
or the formation of a hard crust.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p15.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="592" />
<p class="pcap">Colorful, tasty, all-in-one dishes&mdash;casseroles&mdash;are ideal as the main dish for
luncheon or supper. They are the solution to clever disguising of left-over foods.
They are the answer to time-saving, before-hand meal preparation. The casserole
dish can be prepared several hours in advance, refrigerated, and later
placed in the oven so as to be piping hot by meal time.</p>
<p class="pcapc">As a rule, casserole dishes are made up of various combinations of a protein
food, a starch, a vegetable, and a sauce. The sauce is either white sauce,
plain or varied, or a cream soup. The starch may be noodles, spaghetti, macaroni,
crackers, potatoes or potato chips, bread crumbs or a cereal. The protein
food may be meat, fish, poultry or cheese. Often the vegetables and protein
foods are leftovers which are cleverly combined to appear dressed-up in a
new attire.</p>
<p class="pcapc">For the majority of casserole dishes, a medium white sauce is the right
consistency&mdash;the proportions being 2 tablespoons butter to 2 tablespoons flour,
&frac12; teaspoon salt, few grains pepper, and 1 cup milk. Thin sauce can be made
by using 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon flour to 1 cup milk.</p>
</div>
<p><b>VARIATIONS</b>: Added zest enhancing the flavor of casserole dishes can be obtained
by varying the sauce.</p>
<p><b>SUGGESTIONS</b>: (These proportions are for 1 cup white sauce.)</p>
<p><b>PARSLEY SAUCE</b>: Add 2 to 4 tablespoons chopped parsley after sauce has cooled.</p>
<p><b>HORSERADISH SAUCE</b>: Add &frac14; cup grated horseradish, drained, and &frac14; teaspoon
dry mustard.</p>
<p><b>CHEESE SAUCE</b>: Add &frac12; cup grated cheese and a dash of paprika. Stir over low
heat until cheese is melted, or substitute 1&frac12; teaspoons Worcestershire Sauce for
paprika.</p>
<p><b>OLIVE SAUCE</b>: Add 1 egg, unbeaten, &frac14; cup light cream and cook over hot
water 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add &#8531; cup chopped ripe or stuffed olives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c75"><span class="small"><i>Other Uses</i></span></h2>
<h5 id="c76">GARNISHES:</h5>
<p>Many gay garnishes are easily made from raw vegetables. Place garnishes, such
as radish roses, celery curls or carrot sticks in a bowl of ice water for crisping.
Later these vegetables can be wrapped in a damp cloth and stored in the refrigerator
crisper until ready to serve.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" id="ncfig16" alt="uncaptioned" width="800" height="594" />
</div>
<p>Sandwiches and hors d&rsquo;oeuvres can
be successfully stored for several
hours in the household refrigerator.
It is especially important that the
bread for hors d&rsquo;oeuvres or sandwiches
be spread generously with butter. This is to prevent the filling from
soaking into the bread. Wrap sandwiches in waxed paper and then in a damp
cloth. If they are arranged on trays, cover with waxed paper and a damp cloth.
Sandwich fillings, too, can be stored in the refrigerator until serving time.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
